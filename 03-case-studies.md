## Power Generation

Synengco was founded out of the experience and learnings from a combined experience of over 25 years from working in the industry. Power Generation has been our bread and butter ever since. It is an evolving industry that is requiring more and more real-time advanced analytics and decision support to ensure electricity is provided in a cost effective and sustainable manner, regardless of the source. The high criticality, dynamics and complexity mean we are constantly faced with difficult problems to solve, meaning our development can stay cutting-edge.

### Soot Blowing

Many of our power generation clients have benefited from applying [SentientSystem](www.sentientsystem.com){:target="_blank"} for real-time optimisation of their soot blowing schedule. In all cases, our payback period has been under 12 months, most of which were less than 6 months.

### Early Warning

Another popular offering of ours is configuring [SentientSystem](www.sentientsystem.com){:target="_blank"} for early w warning and detection of faults on our client's plant. By using the hybrid fundamental engineering model + empirical data models, the real-time predictive capability that client's gain allows them to be notified of subtle issues well before they turn into big problems.

## Oil and Gas

For the past 5 years we've been providing monitoring and early-warning in the oil and gas industry for compressor stations and gas-fired power stations with a lot of success. By operationalising the work of engineers in real-time, we are able to identify opportunities and issues quickly at a very low cost.

On top of our on-going offering to clients in the area, we've recently been configuring [SentientSystem](www.sentientsystem.com){:target="_blank"} to provide real-time monitoring and optimisation for wells and pumps, specifically within the coal seam gas industry. Drawing upon our existing work in the area, we've been working on some experiments with real data from the field with some promising results. It is always nice to know that our offering translates to other parts of the oil and gas value stream, and our team is loving learning the intricacies of new processes, systems and problems.
