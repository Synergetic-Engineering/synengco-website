## Power Generation

Synengco was founded out of a combined experience of over 25 years working in the industry. Power generation has been our bread and butter ever since. It is an evolving industry, requiring more and more real-time advanced analytics and decision support, to ensure electricity is provided in a cost effective and sustainable manner, regardless of the source. The high criticality, dynamics and complexity mean we are constantly faced with difficult and unique problems to solve, meaning our development can stay cutting-edge.

### Soot Blowing

Many of our power generation clients have benefited from applying [SentientSystem](http://sentientsystem.com){:target="_blank"} for real-time optimisation to their soot blowing schedule. In all cases, the payback period has been under 12 months, most of which were less than 6 months.

### Early Warning

Configuring [SentientSystem](http://sentientsystem.com){:target="_blank"} for early warning and detection of faults on our client's plant is another popular offering of ours. By using the hybrid fundamental engineering model in conjunction with empirical data models, the real-time predictive capability that clients gain allows them to be notified of subtle issues well before they turn into big problems.

## Oil and Gas

For the past 5 years, we have been successfully providing monitoring and early-warning systems in the oil and gas industry, primarily for compressor stations and gas-fired power stations. By operationalising the work of engineers in real-time, we are able to identify opportunities and issues quickly and at a very low cost.

On top of our on-going offering to clients in the area, we've recently been configuring [SentientSystem](http://sentientsystem.com){:target="_blank"} to provide real-time monitoring and optimisation for wells and pumps, specifically within the coal seam gas industry. Drawing upon our existing work in the area, we've been working on some experiments with real data from the field with some promising results. It is always nice to know that our offering translates to other parts of the oil and gas value stream, and our team is loving learning the intricacies of new processes, systems and problems.
