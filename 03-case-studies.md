## Oil and Gas

For the past 5 years we've been providing monitoring and early-warning for compressor stations and gas-fired power stations with a lot of success. By operationalising the work of engineers in real-time, we are able to identify opportunities and issues quickly at a very low cost.

On top of our on-going offering to clients in the area, we've recently been configuring [SentientSystem](www.sentientsystem.com){:target="_blank"} to provide real-time monitoring and optimisation for wells and pumps, specifically within the coal seam gas industry.  Drawing upon our existing work in the area, we been working on some experiments with real data from the field with some good successes. It is always nice to know that our offering translates to other parts of the value stream, and our team loves learning the intracacies of new processes, systems and problems.

### Modelling a Positive Cavity Pump (PCP)

As a demonstration of our learnings, we've coded up our virtual PCP model for others to use in an online calculator.

## Power Generation

Synengco was founded out of the experience and learnings from a combined experience of over 25 years from working in the industry.
