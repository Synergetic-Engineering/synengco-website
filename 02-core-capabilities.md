We build four core capabilities within oranisations: Model, Monitor, Predict, Optimise.

Each of these work together to

## Model

To effectively understand an operation and the assets it uses, we first ensure
that it can be logically represented in a flexible Information Model.

Instead of buying solutions and contorting your assets and processes to fit
their pre-defined standards, we model the operation first then map data and
configure the solution to suit the problem.

## Monitor

Once we've got a grip on the operation, it's time to start monitoring it.

## Predict

With some fundamental knowledge and historical data about an operation we can
start to use machine learning to predict how it will perform under different
circumstances.

## Optimise

The monitoring and prediction gives us a great understanding of where the
operation is now and where it can go to. From here we can start applying
optimisation techinques to
