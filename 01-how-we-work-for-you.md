At Synengco, we are passionate about reducing waste. We do this by amplifying
the efforts of people that can make a difference.

We deliver [four core capabilities]({{ site.baseurl }}/core-capabilities/)
to these people and the organisations they work in: Model, Monitor, Predict &
Optimise. With these capabilities at hand, better, actionable decisions can be
made to improve an operation. These are based on the current position of the
organisation and a deep understanding of the levers available and environment it
is working within.

We believe that sustainable improvement can not depend on one single solution.
Because of this, our philosophy is to develop these capabilities as a framework
that we can wire our solutions into, but that can also be used to implement
other solutions, either internal or external.

If you think you or your organisation could benefit from these capabilities,
please contact us below.
