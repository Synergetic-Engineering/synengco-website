At Synengco, we are passionate about reducing waste. We do this by giving more time to people that can make a difference.

We deliver [four core capabilities]({{ site.baseurl }}/core-capabilities/) to these people and the organisations they work in: Model, Monitor, Predict & Optimise. With these capabilities in hand, we are able to work with our clients to automate analysis and processes to reduce the amount of time people are spending on lower level tasks, increasing their ability to focus on higher value work so that better, actionable decisions can be made to improve an operation.

We believe that sustainable improvement can not depend on one single solution. Because of this, our philosophy is to develop these capabilities as a framework that we can wire our solutions into, but that can also be used to implement other solutions, either internal or external.

If you think you or your organisation could benefit from these capabilities, please contact us below.
