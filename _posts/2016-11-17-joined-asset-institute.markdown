Synengco and the Asset Institute have been working together for quite some time
now, first with their predecessor CIEAM (Collaborative Research Centre for
Infrastructure and Engineering Asset Management). When we heard that they have
implemented a new membership type geared towards small businesses like
ourselves, we jumped at the opportunity to sign up.

The Asset Institute is a translational research institute based at Queensland
University of Technology in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.

We are currently working with the Asset Institute on a number of promising
projects.
