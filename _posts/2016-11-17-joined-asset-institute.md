Synengco and the [Asset Institute](http://assetinstitute.com/) have been working together for quite some time now, first with their predecessor CIEAM (Collaborative Research Centre for Infrastructure and Engineering Asset Management). When we heard that they have implemented a new membership type geared towards small to medium enterprises like ourselves, we jumped at the opportunity to [sign up](http://assetinstitute.com/become-a-member/).

The Asset Institute is a translational research institute based at Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. They have a wide variety of members, large and small from industry and research.

The Asset Institute develops new approaches to define and achieve best-practice economic, environmental and social performance. With the ability to connect private and public asset owners and operators, governments, development partners and aid agencies with a world-class, international network of multidisciplinary research organisations and industry bodies, the Asset Institute aims to make not only a positive difference to the field of asset management by providing collaborative research services, solutions and training, but also to achieve public benefitâ€”making a positive difference to community livelihoods by improving the sustainability and increasing the usefulness of human created assets and infrastructure.

Their kind welcoming has much appreciated and we're well underway work with together on a number of promising projects in the area of health and government asset management.
